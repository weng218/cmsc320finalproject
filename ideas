Ideas for the new project

1. Which account has more negative responses to tweets - Black Lives Matter or Donald Trump? 
  Note - this information would just be from Twitter, no other datasets.
  
2. What are the most ridden pathways from place to place in terms of taxi rides, and for a taxi drive to be most profitable, 
   where should they be near and when at each hour of the day? (For a certain city)

3. Using the Billboard database with the features of the top songs over the years and using this to predict a song's popularity.
